# Human-Activity-Recognition

Human Activity Recognition can be immensely useful in healthcare applications for automatic and intelligent daily activity monitoring. When a person performs various activities in day-to-day life, his smartphone collects the sensorydata sequence and extracts high-efficiency features from original data. Thus with the help of three axial time series data collected by accelerometer and gyroscope, a user’s physical behaviour can be depicted. The project aims to train a deep neural network to recognize one of the six given physical activities, namely ’Walking’, ’Jogging’, ’Upstairs’,’Downstairs’, ’Sitting’, and ’Standing’.In this project, we make use of WISDM dataset.
